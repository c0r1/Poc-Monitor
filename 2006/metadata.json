{"CVE-2006-0987":{"Published":"2006-03-03T11:02:00","summary":"The default configuration of ISC BIND before 9.4.1-P1, when configured as a caching name server, allows recursive queries and provides additional delegation information to arbitrary IP addresses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via DNS queries with spoofed source IP addresses. This vulnerability affects ISC, BIND versions 9.3.2 and previous."},"CVE-2006-2842":{"Published":"2006-06-06T20:06:00","summary":"** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in functions/plugin.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, if register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the plugins array parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that Squirrelmail provides prominent warnings to the administrator when register_globals is enabled.  Since the varieties of administrator negligence are uncountable, perhaps this type of issue should not be included in CVE.  However, the original developer has posted a security advisory, so there might be relevant real-world environments under which this vulnerability is applicable. Successful exploitation requires that \"register_globals\" is enabled and \"magic_quotes_gpc\" is disabled."},"CVE-2006-3392":{"Published":"2006-07-06T20:05:00","summary":"Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using \"..%01\" sequences, which bypass the removal of \"../\" sequences before bytes such as \"%01\" are removed from the filename.  NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274."}}
